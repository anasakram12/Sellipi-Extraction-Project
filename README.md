# Sellipi-Extraction-Project
Extract characters from Sellipi stone inscriptions in Sri Lanka. Image processing, segmentation, automated/manual extraction, and enhancement techniques. Python, OpenCV, NumPy.
## Overview

This repository hosts the Sellipi Extraction Project, an image processing initiative dedicated to extracting characters from historical Sellipi stone inscriptions discovered across various regions of Sri Lanka. The project aims to unravel the rich cultural heritage encoded in these inscriptions, providing insights into ancient practices and potential solutions to contemporary challenges.

## Key Features

- **Image Acquisition:** Meticulously gathered high-definition images of Sinhala inscriptions from diverse sources.
  
- **Pre-processing:** Techniques like resizing, denoising, and histogram equalization to enhance image clarity under varying conditions.
  
- **Text Segmentation:** Utilized thresholding, Canny edge detection, and region-based segmentation to isolate Sinhala text effectively.
  
- **Extraction:** Explored both automatic and manual extraction methods, capturing characters for further analysis.

- **Character Enhancement:** Improved visibility using contrast adjustment, morphology operations, and adaptive filtering.

## Methodology

### 1. Image Acquisition

High-quality images were collected from various internet sources, ensuring a diverse dataset capturing different angles and styles of Sellipi inscriptions.

### 2. Pre-processing

Implemented resizing, denoising using median blur, and histogram equalization to standardize and enhance image quality.

### 3. Text Segmentation

Experimented with thresholding, Canny edge detection, and region-based segmentation to isolate Sinhala text effectively.

### 4. Extraction

Explored automatic extraction through contour analysis and manual extraction facilitated by user-defined regions.

### 5. Character Enhancement

Focused on contrast adjustment, morphology operations, and adaptive filtering to enhance the quality of extracted characters.

## Challenges Faced

- **Diverse Inscription Styles:** Adapting segmentation techniques to accommodate various Sellipi inscription styles.
  
- **Contrast and Lighting Variations:** Balancing enhancement techniques to handle pixel contrast under different lighting conditions.

- **Stone Irregularities:** Addressing challenges in detecting carvings on stones with irregularities and decay.

## Insights Gained

- **Manual and Automatic Extraction:** In-depth knowledge gained in both manual and automatic character extraction methods.

- **Image Segmentation Techniques:** Explored various segmentation methods, including thresholding and edge detection.

- **Continuous Iteration with Parameters:** Importance of continuous adjustments to parameters in different stages of image processing.

## Conclusion

This project expanded our understanding of image processing and offered a nuanced approach to character extraction from Sinhala inscriptions.
